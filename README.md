# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview
### Background
AutosRUs’ management team has asked that the production data be reviewed for insights that may help the manufacturing team address production issues with AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar.

### Tasks
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
